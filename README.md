# antColonyOptimisation (ACO)

This is a springboot app, that is an implementation of the Ant Colony Opimisation algorithm, as described in Grokking 'Artificial Intelligence Algorithms', written by Rishal Hurbane, published by Manning.

# How to use

The starting point, is the unit test com.eon.ants.service.ProblemSpaceTest. Here is modelled an example from the aforementioned book.

# The Problem

This is a variation of the travelling salesman Problem, in which the task is to find the fastest route around an amusement park, visiting all attractions exactly once. The idea is that, given an adjacency matrix, with a corresponding list of attractions, using ACO, find a shortest possible route.
